<P>Purpose</P>
</B>
<P>OpenWDDX.org--currently sponsored by Macromedia, Inc.--is devoted to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the continuing community-based evolution and broad adoption of the WDDX Specification;</LI> 
<LI>the development and wide availability of WDDX Projects; and </LI>
<LI>the support of the WDDX developer community.</LI> 
</UL>

<p>The purpose of the WDDX Public License, or WPL, is to further the goals of OpenWDDX.org by:</p>
<UL>
<li>encouraging broad sharing and distribution of WDDX Project source and non-source materials; </li>
<li>preventing members of the WDDX developer community from accidentally waiving copyrights or incurring liability for freely distributing source and non-source materials; and </li>
<li>encouraging the consistent evolutionary development of the WDDX Specification through communication of modifications that are not compliant with or add to the WDDX Specification back to OpenWDDX.org.</li> 
</UL>

<p><B>The WDDX Specification and WDDX Projects</B></p>

<p>The WDDX Specification is made up of documents and other materials that have been prepared and made available to the WDDX developer community. The WDDX Specification is currently sponsored by Macromedia, Inc. and is available from www.OpenWDDX.org. The WDDX Specification is expected to change from time to time; as used in this license, the term "WDDX Specification" refers to the most current released version.</p>

<p>WDDX Projects (sometimes just called "Projects" in this license) are programming language and technology-specific serializer/deserializer implementations based on the WDDX Specification. Projects may include source materials (which may be modified and distributed under this License) and non-source materials (which may not be modified but may be distributed under this license). For more information on the WDDX Specification, available WDDX Projects and the WDDX developer community, please visit www.OpenWDDX.org. </p>

<p>Scope of the WDDX Public License</p>

<p>This license applies to:</p>

<ul>
<li>WDDX Projects-including source and non-source materials-provided by OpenWDDX.org or Macromedia, Inc.; and</li> 
<li>any WDDX Project-including source and non-source materials-which contains a notice from the holder of the copyright saying that the Project is subject to this WDDX Public License.</li> 
</ul>

<p>This license does not apply to any other software or other copyrighted work that does not state that it is subject to this license. Specific portions of Projects and other materials provided by OpenWDDX.org or Macromedia, Inc. or otherwise subject to this WDDX Public License may be subject to copyrights held by others and subject to different license terms. Please see the appropriate text files or other end-user documents for the license terms and conditions governing those portions. </p>

<p>You are not required to accept this license, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute WDDX Projects. Projects are protected by the copyright laws of the United States and international treaty provisions. There are severe penalties, both civil and criminal, for copyright infringement. Therefore, by copying, modifying or distributing a WDDX Project covered by this license (or any work based on that Project), you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Project or works based on it. </p>

<p><b>Licensing Terms Applicable to both Source and Non-Source Materials</b></p>

<p>Source materials include only materials identified as source materials. Non-Source materials include any materials that are not identified as source materials. </p>

<p>You may copy and distribute exact copies of both source and non-source materials, in any medium, but only if each of the following conditions are met:</p>

<ol>
<li>you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy the holder's copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;</li> 
<li>you keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty; and </li>
<li>you give any other recipients of the copy (along with the copy) a copy of this license.</li>
</ol>

<p>Source and non-source materials are provided by the OpenWDDX.org and Macromedia, Inc. royalty-free. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the copyright holder's notice referring to this license, you can assume that Projects provided by other copyright holders are also provided royalty-free. A fee may be charged for any warranty provided for a Project covered by this license. </p>

<p><b>Licensing Terms Applicable only to Source Materials</b></p>

<p>You may modify source materials for the purposes of designing, developing and testing your own Projects. However, you are permitted to copy and redistribute the modified source materials only if each of the conditions set forth in the prior section are met, and in addition each of the following additional conditions are met:</p>
<ol>
<li>the modified source and non-source materials carry prominent notices stating that you changed the materials and the date of any change; and</li> 
<li>If your modification causes the source or non-source materials to become non-compliant with the WDDX specification, you first provide a copy (by email to source@OpenWDDX.org) of the modified work to the OpenWDDX.org without charge, accompanied by a notification that the modification is non-compliant and a brief description of the nature of the non-compliance.</li>
</ol>

<p>The second condition is not intended to prevent you from modifying the source materials in any way, or even to prevent you from distributing Projects that do not comply with the WDDX Specification. Instead, the second condition will help the WDDX organization to monitor Project innovations and evolve the WDDX specification in response to compelling or popular modifications. </p>

<p><b>No Additional Rights or Licenses</b></p>

<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute any Project subject to this license except as expressly provided by this license. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Project (or any work based on the Project) is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this license. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. You may not remove or alter any copyright or other proprietary notices on any source or non-source materials. </p>

<p>This license does not authorize you to use the name of the WDDX Organization, OpenWDDX.org, Macromedia, Inc., and other copyright holder using this license or any of their trademarks to endorse or promote Projects or works based on Projects subject to this license.</p>

<p><b>No Warranty and Limitation of Remedies</b></p>

<p><b>MACROMEDIA, INC., THE WDDX ORGANIZATION AND OTHER COPYRIGHT HOLDERS USING THIS LICENSE PROVIDE NO REMEDIES OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, FOR ANY PORTION OF ANY WDDX PROJECT OR OTHER MATERIALS SUBJECT TO THIS LICENSE, ALL OF WHICH IS PROVIDED "AS IS." 
IN NO CASE SHALL MACROMEDIA, INC., THE WDDX ORGANIZATION OR ANY OTHER COPYRIGHT HOLDER USING THIS LICENSE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS OR THE INABILITY TO USE EQUIPMENT OR ACCESS DATA, WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE BASED UPON A BREACH OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, BREACH OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY. THIS IS TRUE EVEN IF THE HOLDER IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO CASE WILL A COPYRIGHT HOLDER'S LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF THE LICENSE FEE, IF ANY, ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU. 
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES SO THE WARRANTY LANGUAGE ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH CASE, ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER'S LIABILITIES SHALL BE LIMITED BY THE PROVISIONS ABOVE LIMITING LIABILITY.</b></p>

<p><b>U.S. Government Licensing Rights; Notification of Export Restriction</b></p>

U.S. Government agencies and entities and others acquiring under a U.S. Government contract shall have only those rights, and shall be subject to all restrictions, set forth in this license.</p>
